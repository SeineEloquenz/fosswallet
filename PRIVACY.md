# How FossWallet uses your data
**FossWallet does not collect any of your personal data.**

If you grant FossWallet network access, you can update supported passes via an "update button" on the pass.
If you enable the automatic pass update setting, FossWallet will regularly check for updates for all updatable passes in the app from the passes' vendor servers.
When performing an update, the app will transmit the pass identifier and authentication token to the vendor service specified in the pass to retrieve a new version of the pass.
This explicit opt-in feature is the only way in which FossWallet will ever transmit data off your device.
If the hide feature is used, the corresponding pass will neither be encrypted nor will the original file be deleted.
