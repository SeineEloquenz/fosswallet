* Add settings screen for pass updates
* Utilize charset from pass and only fallback to UTF-8 if it is unknown.
Note: This will only apply to passes imported from this version onward. Old passes will still default to UTF-8 unless deleted and re-imported.
* Fix wrong pass display if no logo or logo text exists
